# ThinkUp MVI sample

The purpose of this project is to show how we work with the MVI architecture for every project in ThinkUp.

## How to start

We start from the scratch using a template project with the following characteristics:
- Fully kotlin development
- Fully compose UI
- Modularization layers
- CI/CD integrates (Firebase App Distribution + Fastlane + Gitlab Runner)
- Custom reusable components stack (see 'com.thinkup.mvi.ui.shared' package)
- Firebase notifications
- Dagger Hilt Dependencies injection
- Fully Android 13 and below support 

## Setup

if you want to run the app directly from the code remember ask to your ThinkUp contact for the remaining files to complete the configuration.
However, if you just would like take a tour from the app can you join to te open testing canal (here)[https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.thinkup.mvi.staging]
